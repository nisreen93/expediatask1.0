Expedia web application with back-end service.

Build on Java Language - because I am working on java since 2 year(s) ago, and I had a good experience in building web and rest application with it.

I built in this web application a front-end UI with bootstrap and JSP, that call back-end API to get the result for chosen API.

I was learning about Junit testing and how can I upload and deploy my application on heroku.
